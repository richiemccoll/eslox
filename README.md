# ESLox

This is the ECMAScript implementation of the lox language from the [Crafting Interpreters book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

This is a toy language that I've been using to go through the motions of creating an interpreter. It is not intended for use in any other context.
## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - run the ESLox REPL
- `npm run debug` - run the REPL but open the inspector debugging port
- `npm run test` - run the suite of unit tests

##  Language features

- Check out the public API spec [here](./__tests__/eslox.spec.js).
